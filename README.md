New BU KTP Website.

# How to Run Locally
1. Fork the repository (https://github.com/ktpbu/website)
2. Step 2: Open your repository locally
3. Run the Back-End:
Open a terminal window for running the back-end. You will need a .env for the backend to run which can be found in Google Drive. Contact one of the contributors for access.
```
cd backend
npm i
npm run dev
```
If you followed the steps above, you should get the following output:
```
Server listening on port 3000
Connected to MongoDB
```


4. Run the Front-End:
Open a new terminal window for running the front-end. You will need another .env file also in the same Google Drive.
```
cd ktp-website
npm i
npm run dev
```

5. Connect to the website at http://localhost:5173/
