          KTP was founded on January 10, 2012, at the University of Michigan. It was started
          with the mission to create a tech community that enthusiastic students could join.
          In making KTP, the founders set up a strong community that has only grown in the 11
          years since its inception.

          scientists, engineers, artists, entrepreneurs, economists, philosophers, psychologists,
          and more. What makes the KTP community strong is our shared passion for technology
          and our unique backgrounds meshing together as one.

               had the idea to bring a new kind of fraternity to Boston and bring together STEM majors from all kinds of backgrounds,
                spiritually similar to the dream of Louise and Jing just over a decade ago. Tye and Paul ran interviews for E-Board and Lambda
                 grew to include 8 more people: Evan Lapid, Jaden Hsiao, Camille Herzog, Rylie Love, Peachy Malik, Anissa Patel, Patrick Blejwas, and George Audi.

               KTP's presence at BU is in the midst of an exciting expansion, and our mission to unite STEM students from diverse disciplines, backgrounds,
                and aspirations is actively evolving. Moreover, new chapters are continually sprouting up across the nation, as if the history of our fraternity is writing itself in real-time.
